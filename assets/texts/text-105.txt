The treatment of atoms with more than one electron requires consideration of the effects of interelectronic repulsion, orbital penetration towards the nuclear shielding, and an extra quantum number which specifies the intrinsic energy of the electron in any orbital.  All these considerations are necessary to allow construction of the modern form of the periodic classification of the elements.
