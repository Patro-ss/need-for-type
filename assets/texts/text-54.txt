Yeah, you just take Soupy-Sales to
prom 'cause I can think of so many cooler things to do that night. I
might pumice my feet, I might go to Bren's Unitarian Church, maybe get
hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice, you know? Cause all those
things, would be exponentially cooler than going to prom with
you.
