It takes more than a calorie of
fossil fuel energy to produce a calorie of food. From the standpoint
of industrial efficiency, it's too bad we can't simply drink the
petroleum directly, because there's a lot less energy in a bushel of
corn (measured in calories) than there is in the half gallon or so of
oil required to produce it. Ecologically this is a fabulously
expensive way to produce food.
