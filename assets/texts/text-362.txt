Every time I think of you I feel
shot right through with a bolt of blue. It's no problem of mine but
it's a problem I find, living a life that I can't leave behind.
There's no sense in telling me the wisdom of a fool won't set you
free. But that's the way that it goes, and it's what nobody knows,
while every day my confusion grows.
