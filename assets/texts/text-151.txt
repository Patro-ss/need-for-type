There are two places on Earth that
serve as canaries in the coal mine - regions that are especially
sensitive to the effects of global warming. The first is the Arctic.
The second is the Antarctic. In both of these frozen realms,
scientists are seeing faster changes and earlier more dramatic effects
of climate change than anywhere else on Earth.
