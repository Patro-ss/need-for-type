With the coming of Dean Moriarty
began the part of my life you could call my life on the road. Before
that I'd often dreamed of going West to see the country, always
vaguely planning and never taking off. Dean is the perfect guy for the
road because he actually was born on the road, when his parents were
passing through Salt Lake City.
