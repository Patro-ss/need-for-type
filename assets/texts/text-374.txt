In general, many of these targets
are easier marks if you are wearing the correct uniform. You should
always have one suit or fashionable dress outfit hanging in the closet
for the proper heists. Specialized uniforms, such as nun and priest
garb, can be most helpful. Check out your local uniform store for a
wide range of clothes that will get you in, and especially out, of all
kinds of stores.
