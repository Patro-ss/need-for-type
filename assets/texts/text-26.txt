What should have been swift revenge
turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided. You couldn't
go from one section to the other, not even to visit a relative. The
cops considered anyone living in the slum a hoodlum. People got used
to living in Vietnam, and more and more volunteers signed up to
die.
