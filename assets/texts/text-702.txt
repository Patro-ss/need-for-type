Buddhism addresses two major types of meditation. Vipassana can be translated as "insight," a clear awareness of exactly what is happening as it happens. Samatha can be translated as "concentration" or "tranquility". It is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused only on one item and not allowed to wander.
