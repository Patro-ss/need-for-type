You have to wonder: how do the
machines know what Tasty Wheat tasted like? Maybe they got it wrong.
Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like
oatmeal, or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things.
You take chicken, for example: maybe they couldn't figure out what to
make chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like
everything.
