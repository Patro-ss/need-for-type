In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened the
harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of
his people join their relatives in the United States. Within
seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. It soon
became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back
with them not only their relatives, but the dregs of his
jails.
