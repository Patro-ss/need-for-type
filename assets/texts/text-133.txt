We sit silently and watch the world
around us. This has taken us a lifetime to learn. It seems only the
old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still
feel content. The young, brash and impatient, must always break the
silence. It is a waste, for silence is pure. Silence is holy. It draws
people together because only those who are comfortable with each other
can sit without speaking. This is the great paradox.
