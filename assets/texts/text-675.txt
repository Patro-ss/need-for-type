Don't practice too much at first, or you're likely to develop incorrect patterns or movements. Instead, begin with a few laps, maintaing intense concentration and motivation. If you begin to repeat an error, or if your concentration or attention starts to fade, if you start to become casual, then stop. Clear your head, get your concentration and motivation back, then go again.
