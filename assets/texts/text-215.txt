You found paradise in America. You
had a good trade, made a good living, the police protected you and
there were courts of law and you didn't need a friend like me. But,
now you come to me and you say, "Don Corleone, give me
justice." But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer
friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather.
